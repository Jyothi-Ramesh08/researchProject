                        Stem cells are unspecialized cells that can divide and become specialized cells. They are a crucial part of how organisms replenish cells 
                        that have been lost due to injury. Planaria, a type of flatworm, is useful for studying stem cells because it has multipotent stem cells. 
                        This means that their stem cells can divide and differentiate into any type of cell. Using these cells, they are able to regenerate huge parts of their bodies. 
                        They do this by having their stem cells gather at the site of injury and multiply there, rebuiliding the worm. ​To study the effect that external factors can have on
                        this, we investigated how the bacteria E.coli K-12 effects planarian regeneration.</p>

                    <h1 class="ovPadLeft">Rationale</h1> <!-- ovPagLeft = custom passing left side-->
                    <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft">While there has been a lot of research on how stem cells divide and differentiate, 
                                                             markedly less research has been done on how environmental factors affect stem cell division and planaria. 
                                                             There has also been very little research done on how bacteria specifically affects stem cells, as most research has 
                                                             focused on other substances such as RNA or indoles. Understanding how stem cells perform under different conditions increases
                                                             knowledge about the mechanics of stem cells. How stem cells are affected by outside factors is especially important to scientists trying 
                                                             to grow whole organs from stem cells because the stem cells need to be in good enough condition that they can withstand external factors such as bacteria and RNA. 
                                                             The effects of bacteria can also be compared with the effect of other factors to understand how different factors can impact stem cells. 
                                                             Finally, this leads to increased knowledge of planarian behavior.</p>

                    <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft"><p>This project was done in the class Research Practicum at High Technology High School. In this class,
                                                            sophomores come up with a research question and hypothesis and carry out a research project. 
                                                            In my project, I studied the effect that the bacteria E.coli K-12 had on planarian regneration in terms of number of days the 
                                                            planaria took to regenerate. 
                                                            <br></p>
                                                            <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> A stem cell's ability to divide can be negatively impacted by outside factors like RNA and indoles. 
                                                                This may be because these factors reduce a cell’s ability to translate/express certain genes. Bacterial infections will also interfere with stem cell division, 
                                                                causing the planaria’s regeneration to be negatively affected.

                                                            <p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Planaria that are infected with more E.coli K-12 will take longer 
                                                                to regenerate than those infected less
                                                            <br></p>
                                                            <p><strong>Independent Variable:</strong> amount of E.coli K-12 added
                                                            <br></p>
                                                            <p><strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> number of days the planaria took to regenerate
                                                            <br></p>
                                                            <p>I found that while the planaria took a longer amount of time to regenerate, the length they regenerated to was similar 
                                                                (short term efficiency affected, but long term regeneration unaffected).</p>
